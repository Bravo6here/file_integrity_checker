# file_integrity_checker
If you have files which are indexed with three digits and want to know integrity of them you can use this.

How to use:
Replace the 3 by how many digits your numbers have 001 = 3, 0001 = 4, etc.
                         v
rawlist.append(int(name[:3]))
Add path to the directory hier.
                  v
directory_path = ' '

Thats all

The program works only if your files all have same number of digits and the number is at the start of the name.
